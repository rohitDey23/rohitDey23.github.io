## About Me
Hello there!👋,  I'm a robotics 🤖 and AI enthusiast for most of the time, and a PhD candidate 🎓 at WPI for the rest. My curousity in the field of robotics and automations have led me to work on wide variety of problems ranging from localizing Autonomous Ground Vechiles (AGVs) to navigating Drones and now developing Medical Robots for surgery. 

I'm always keen on picking up new skills 😇 and up for collaborating on exciting projects with like-minded innovators 🤝.
