<div style="text-align: justify"> <p> Hello! üëã I'm a passionate robotics and AI enthusiast ü§ñ, and a PhD candidate at WPI üéì. My curiosity in robotics and automation has driven me to tackle a diverse range of challenges, from localizing Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) to navigating drones, and now, developing medical robots for surgery.</p>

<p>I am always eager to acquire new skills and thrive on collaborating with like-minded innovators on exciting projects. üòá If you share my passion for advancing robotics and AI,ü§ù I'd love to connect and explore potential collaborations.</p>
